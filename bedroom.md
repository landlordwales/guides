# Bedroom Guide


Below is a guide that you may already be aware of however history has shown this is not always the case.


Ceiling:

A damp patch or mark could mean a leak in the roof therefore:

If you notice any damp patches or marks contact your landlord
Failure to do so could lead to costly repairs
Under no circumstances perform any repairs yourself

Windows:

Provide appropriate ventilation to avoid moisture build up. 

If mould develops soak kitchen roll in clear bleach and leave for a few hours and then wipe clean
