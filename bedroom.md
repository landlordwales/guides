# Bedroom Guide

### Ceiling

A damp patch or mark could mean a leak in the roof therefore:

If you notice any damp patches or marks

- contact your landlord
- failure to do so could lead to costly repairs
- do not perform any repairs yourself

### Windows

- Provide appropriate ventilation to avoid moisture build up.

If mould develops soak kitchen roll in clear bleach and leave for a few hours and then wipe clean.
